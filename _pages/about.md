Welcome! This is the personal page of Philipp Altrock, Project Group Leader at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology. 

**Brief bio**: In the Department of Evolutionary Theory at the Max Planck Instute for Evolutionary Biology in Ploen, Germany, Dr. Philipp Martin Altrock iworks on cancer evolutionary dynamics. From 2017-21, he was a group leader at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. After an amazing research stay there, he and his family decided to move back to Europe to be closer to their families and improve dual career options. Philipp was a postdoctoral trainee at Harvard University and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, under supervised by Franziska Michor (2013-17), and obtained his doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) from Kiel University, supervised by Arne Traulsen, in 2011. In 2007, he received a Diplom in physics under supervision of Ulrich Behn at Leipzig University. Philipp was awarded a Leopoldina fellowship for his work at Harvard, and received the Moffitt Cancer Center 2020 Junior Faculty Resaerch Award. 

Philipp and his team investigate how the ecology of tumors can be quantified in order to better understand the role of selection on cancer, stroma, and immune cells during tumor evoluion and progression. In this context, Philipp's work focuses on quantification of tumor phenotypic and immunologic heterogeneity, on immune system interactions during cellular immunotherapy, and on nonlinear models of selection in cancer systems.
