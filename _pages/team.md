We are located at the <u><a href="https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology</a></u>, in the <u><a href="https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/16397/group_evolutionarytheory">Department of Evolutionary Theory</a></u>, where we focus our research efforts on ecological complexity, evolutionary dynamics and immune-interactions in cancer and the hematopoietic system. We apply nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and statistics to integrate models with data and make clinically relevant predictions.
