We are located at the <u><a href="https://www.uksh.de" target="_blank">University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel</a></u>, in the <u><a href="https://www.uksh.de/med2-kiel/" target="_blank">Department for Hematology, Oncology</a></u>, where we focus our research efforts on ecological complexity, evolutionary dynamics and immune-interactions in cancer and the hematopoietic system. We apply nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic processes, data science, and statistics to integrate models with data and make clinically relevant predictions.

Collaborators

Our highly interdisciplinary work combines research approaches and methods from biomathematics, computational biology, statistics, hematology, oncology, pathology, immunology, ecology of cancer, and evolution. 

At the University of Kiel, we work with the teams of <u><a href="https://www.medizin.uni-kiel.de/en/deans-office/deans/baldus">Claudia Baldus</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.uksh.de/haematologielabor-kiel/Wir+%C3%BCber+uns/Team/Leitung.html">Monika Brüggemann</a></u> on heterogeneity and predicitve modeling of leukemia and lymphoma, as well as with <u><a href="https://www.iet.uni-kiel.de/en">Susanne Sebens</a></u> on tumor heterogeneity and metastasis.

Together with the group of <u><a href="https://moffitt.org/providers/frederick-locke/">Frederick L. Locke</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.uni-kiel.de/de/detailansicht/news/119-portrait-friedrich-stoelzel">Friedrich Stölzel</a></u> we work on better understanding cellular and drug kinetics during CAR T cell therapy. 

With the groups of <u><a href="https://labpages2.moffitt.org/marusyk/lab-members/">Andriy Marusyk</a></u> and <u><a href="https://lab.moffitt.org/cancerevo/">David Basanta</a></u> we work on tumor-stroma interacitons, tumor ecology, and the effects of cancer associated fibroblasts in lung and breast cancers. 

With <u><a href="https://padronlab.moffitt.org/">Eric Padron</a></u> and his lab we work on inflammatory interactions in chronic myeloid diseases, such as CMML.

With the teams of <u><a href="http://meghan.ferrall-fairbanks.com/">Meghan Ferrall-Fairbanks</a></u> and <u><a href="https://moffitt.org/providers/brandon-manley/">Brandon Manley</a></u> we work on mulitple projects that seek to quantify the immunological and geospatial heterogeneity of cancer. 

Together with <u><a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/116215">Christian Brendel</a></u> we model the cellular kinetics after gene therapy intervention for sickle cell disease.
