We are located at the <u><a href="https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology</a></u>, in the <u><a href="https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/16397/group_evolutionarytheory">Department of Evolutionary Theory</a></u>, where we focus our research efforts on ecological complexity, evolutionary dynamics and immune-interactions in cancer and the hematopoietic system. We apply nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and statistics to integrate models with data and make clinically relevant predictions. 

Students
======

**Álvaro Martinez Rubio** (visiting PhD student)

BSc in Physics (Universidad de Córdoba, 2017). MSc in Applied Mathematics (Imperial College London, 2018). Currently holding a Research Fellowship from Fundación Pablo Ugarte at Cádiz University. Álvaro's resaerch activity focuses on the development of mathematical models and machine learning for predictive modeling and therapy optimisation in childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) treatment, particularly cellular therapy.

**Qianci Yang** (incoming graduate student)

I just finished my bachelor and master (integrated master) at the University of Warwick, UK. My research interest is mathematical and statistical modelling of cancer, evolutionary dynamics and related areas. 


Collaborators
======

Our highly interdisciplinary work combines resaerch approaches and methods from biomathematics, computational biology, statistics, hematology, oncology, pathology, immunology, ecology, and evolution. 

Togther with the group of <u><a href="https://moffitt.org/providers/frederick-locke/">Frederick L. Locke</a></u> we work on better understanding cellular and drug kinetics during CAR T cell therapy. 

With the groups of <u><a href="https://labpages2.moffitt.org/marusyk/lab-members/">Andriy Marusyk</a></u> and <u><a href="https://lab.moffitt.org/cancerevo/">David Basanta</a></u> we work on tumor-stroma interacitons, tumor ecology, and the effects of cancer associated fibroblasts in lung and breast cancers. 

With <u><a href="https://padronlab.moffitt.org/">Eric Padron</a></u> and his lab we work on inflammatory interactions in chronic myeloid diseases, such as CMML.

With the teams of <u><a href="http://meghan.ferrall-fairbanks.com/">Meghan Ferrall-Fairbanks</a></u> and <u><a href="https://moffitt.org/providers/brandon-manley/">Brandon Manley</a></u> we work on mulitple projects that seek to quantify the immunological and geospatial heterogeneity of cancer. 

Together with <u><a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/116215">Christian Brendel</a></u> we model the cellular kinetics after gene therapy intervention for sickle cell disease. 

At the University of Kiel, we work with the teams of <u><a href="https://www.medizin.uni-kiel.de/en/deans-office/deans/baldus">Claudia Baldus</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.uksh.de/haematologielabor-kiel/Wir+%C3%BCber+uns/Team/Leitung.html">Monika Brüggemann</a></u> on heterogeneity and predicitve modeling of leukemia and lymphoma, as well as with <u><a href="https://www.iet.uni-kiel.de/en">Susanne Sebens</a></u> on tumor heterogeneity and metastasis.
