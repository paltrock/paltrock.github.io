I taught together with other faculty members of the IMO (and of USF Mathematics) every Fall Semester from 2018 to 2020. 

We covered the following topics:


- The purpose of mathematical modeling in cancer


- Growth laws, time scales, spatial scales


- The dynamic nature of cancer evolution and cell population dynamics
- 

- Agent-based models for cancer bioliogy
  

- Cancer therapy: resistance, dosing, timing, and adaptive therapy


- Cancer-immune interactions


- Stochastic models of cancer evolution, growth, and response to therapy
