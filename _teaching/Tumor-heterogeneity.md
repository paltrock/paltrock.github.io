This lecture provides a brief introduction to the topic of tumor heterogeneity from the perspective of a mathematical oncologist. 

Learing goals: to be able distinguish forms of tumor heterogeneity, understand that they are a direct result of the complex process of cancer evolution, and to quantify heterogeneity from sequencing or cell classification (labeling) data.

You can find the slides (in German) <a href="http://paltrock.github.io/files/Altrock_Heterogeneity_20240730.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

What are the origins and importance of tumor heterogeneity?
======

- Tumor heterogeneity can result from diversification during the complex process of cancer evolution

- Diversification can result from genetic and epigenetic mutations and genetic instability

- Tumor heterogeneity is believed to be responsible for the evolution of both de novo and preexisting resistance to treatment

Levels of tumor heterogeneity
======

- Interpatient heterogeneity: Cancer cells of different patients can vary dramatically

- Intratumor heterogeneity: Cancer cells of the same patient's tumor can also vary dramatically

- Intertumor heterogeneity: Cancer cells of different sites within one patient, e.g., from primary tumor and metastasis, can be different, but some metastases can be much more homogeneous again, see [PMID: 32451459](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343611/)


To understand tumor heterogeneity, we need to understand cancer evolution
======

- Cancer arises in the process of somatic evolution, that is, through spontaneous diversification and selection in cell populations of the human body.

- A reiteraive process of expansion, diversificaiton, selection can take place.

- By the process of clonal evolution, tumors harvest heterogeneity, depending on the mode of selection (e.g., neutral evolution, clonal interference, punctuated equilibrium, spatially isolated selection events). See this [review](https://doi.org/10.1002/path.4757)


The role of plasticity
======

- There is also evidence of diversification of cellular behavior, called plasticity

- The increasing complexity of a tumor, e.g., driven by disorganized vasculature and conflicting signals to the immune system, opens the door for cellular plasticity programs to persist and for the coexistence of cell phenotypes

- Phenotypic plasticity can result in niches within which cancer cells may better survive therapy and evolve long-term resistance

- Plasticity does not only affect cancer cells, but also the cancer infiltrating stroma and immmune cells, e.g., fibroblasts and T lymphocytes.
  
- Cancer also may inherit some of the tissue's levels of differentiation, e.g., in the form of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are uniquely capable of recapitulating a tumor and give rise to multiple lineages that can contribute in phenotypic tumor heterogeneity.
  

Tumor heterogeneity contributes to resistance to therapy
======

- Radiotherapy: non-dividing persister (cancer stem) cells may not be affected as much

- Chemotherapy: Genetic mutations and phenotypic plasticity can lead to low responses in cancer subpopulations

- Targeted therapy: Persister cells can lead to de novo resistance; low-frequency pre-existing resistance is eventually selected (and may become more aggressive on the way)

- Immune therapy: Immune-evading pathways are enriched during treatment; spatial constraints may hinder immune cell killing


Measuring tumor heterogeneity
======

- Diversity index measures, such as Shannon index or related quantities, see [generalized diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index)

- For example, using the Shannon index, [Almendro et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24462293/) found that intratumor genetic diversity was tumor-subtype specific in breast cancers (comparing Luminal A/B, Triple negative, and Her2+ cancers). Yet, diversity did not change during treatment in tumors with partial or no response.  

- Diversity can also be assessed using median differences of allele frequencies, e.g., using "Mutant Allele Tumor Heterogeneity" (MATH), see [PMID: 26840267](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26840267/)
