What are the origins and importance of tumor heterogeneity?
======

- Tumor heterogeenity can result from diversification during the complex plrocess of cancer evolutoin

- Diversification can result from  genetic and epigenitic mutations and genetic instability

- Tumor heterogeneity is belived to be responsible for evolution of both de novo and preexisting resistance to treatment


Levels of tumor heterogeneity
======

- Cancer cells of different patients can vary dramatically (interpatient heterogeneity)

- Cancer cells o fthe same patient's tumor can also vary dramatically (intratumor heterogeneity)

- Cancer cells of different sites within one patient, e.g., from primary tumor and metastasis, can be different (intertumor heterogeenity), but some metastases can be much more homogeneous than others, see [PMID: 32451459](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343611/)


To understand tumor heterogeneity, we need to understand cancer evolution
======

- Cancer arises in the process of somatic evolution, that is, throigh spontaneous diversifivaiton and selection in cell populations of the human body

- Cancer also may inherit some of the tissue's levels of differentiation, e.g., in form of cancer stem cells (CSCs)

- CSCs are uniquely capable of recaputulating a tumor and give rise to multiple lineages that results in tumor heterogeneity

- By the process of clonal evolution, tumurs harvest heterogeneity, depending on the mode of selection (e.g., neutral evolution, clonal interference, punctuated equilibrium, spatially isolated selection events). See this [review](https://doi.org/10.1002/path.4757)


The role of plasticity
======

- There is also evidence of diversification of cellular behavior, called plasticity

- The increasing complexity of a tumor, e.g., driven by disorganized vasculature and conflicting singals to the immune system, opens the door for cellular plasticity programs to persist and coexistence of cell phenotypes

- Phenotypic plasicity can result in niches within which cancer cells may better survive therapy and evolve long-term resitance

- Plasticity does not only affect cancer cells, but also the cancer infiltrating stroma and immmune cells, e.g., fibroblasts and T lymphocytes
  

Tumor heterogeneity contributes to resistance to therapy
======

- Radiotherapy: non-dividing persister (cancer stem) cells may not be affaected as much

- Chemotherapy: Genetic mutations and phenotypic plasticity can lead to low responses in cancer subpopulaitons

- Targteted therapy: Persister cells can lead to de novo resistance, low-frequency pre-existing resistance is eventually selected (and may become more aggressive on the way)

- Immune-therapy: Immune-evading pathways are enriched during treatment, spatial constraints may hinder immune cell killing


Measuring tumor heterogeneity
======

- Diversity index measures, such as Shannon index or related quantities ([generalized diversity]([https://doi.org/10.1002/path.4757](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index))
