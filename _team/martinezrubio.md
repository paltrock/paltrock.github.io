Currently, I hold a  Research Fellowship from the Fundación Pablo Ugarte at Cádiz University. My resarch activity focuses on the development of mathematical models for therapy optimisation in childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) treatment, whcih includes mechanistic modeling, data science, and machine learning.
